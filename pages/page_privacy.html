        <span>
            5.1. Our Processors determined in para.3.2.1 of this Policy
            implement into the HyperCarrot Applications attribution
            tracking technologies and track the use of the device (e.g.
            smartphone) by HyperCarrot User. In doing this, such
            Processors use the Device ID of the device that aggregates all
            the personal data on the behavior of the device user. In
            particular, such Device ID can aggregate personal data on what
            web-resources the device user visited, which ads did the device
            user click, what applications for mobile devices did the user
            buy or download, how many application launches did the device
            user make. When HyperCarrot User downloads or installs and
            launches HyperCarrot Application, the HyperCarrot
            Application obtains the information about the Device ID that
            belongs to the device of the HyperCarrot User, and tracks all
            the behavioral personal data aggregated on this Device ID.
            Besides, when you launch the HyperCarrot Application, we can
            also receive and process your personal data specified in
            para.4.1.7 of this Policy for purposes determined in Section 6

            the Device IDs of HyperCarrot Users with aggregated tracking

            such Device IDs to the Processors determined in para.3.2.5 of
            this Policy for storage of this personal data. The Controller
            can also transfer such Device IDs to the Processors specified in
            para.3.2.2 of the Policy for the purposes of marketing and
            advertising analytics. Besides, the Controller can transfer
            Device IDs with aggregated tracking information to the

        </span>
        <br>
        <span>
            You have the right, at any time, to direct us not to “sell” the
            your personal information as defined by the CCPA. We use and
            share your information as described in this privacy policy (para
            6 of this Policy) and do not believe this use and sharing is a
            sale as defined by the CCPA.
        </span>

        <span>
            However, we have provided you with a system to record your

        </span>
        <br>
        <span>
            1) send the request via e-mail:
            <a href="mailto:support@hypercarrot.studio" target="_blank">

            15.4. No discrimination based upon the exercise of the opt-out
            right
        </span>
        <br>
        <span>
            We shall not discriminate against a consumer because the
            consumer exercised any of the consumer’s rights under this
            title, including, but not limited to, by:
        </span>
        <br>
        <span>(1) Denying goods or services to the consumer.
        </span>
        <br>
        <span>
            (2) Charging different prices or rates for goods or services,
            including through the use of discounts or other benefits or
            imposing penalties.
        </span>
        <br>
        <span>
            (3) Providing a different level or quality of goods or services
            to the consumer.
        </span>
        <br>
        <span>
            (4) Suggesting that the consumer will receive a different price
            or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of
            goods or services.
        </span>
        <br>
        <span>
            Nothing in this subdivision prohibits us from charging a
            consumer a different price or rate, or from providing a
            different level or quality of goods or services to the consumer,
            if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided
            to us by the consumer’s data.
        </span>
        <br>
        <span>
            If you are a resident of California we can provide access to
            your personal information or delete the same at your specific
            request twice every 12 month without a charge. Please note, in
            order to avoid unauthorized disclosures we shall proceed only in
            case of verifiable consumer request. It will be completed in 45
            days, but in case of necessity we can extend this period by an
            additional 45 days. We shall notify you immediately in that
            case.
